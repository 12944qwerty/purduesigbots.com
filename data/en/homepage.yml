      duration : "2021-2022"
      content : "This season showed significant growth in the size and capabilities of the Purdue ACM SIGBots.  As a result of our largest recruit class to date, Purdue SIGBots expanded to two competition teams, BLRS and BLRS2. With the winding down of the COVID-19 pandemic, Purdue University eased its restrictions on the number of individuals in lab spaces and masking. Subteam meetings returned to being in-person for the first time since 2020, giving new and existing team members alike the chance to meet and work in person. With new opportunities came new challenges, as funding became more difficult with the return to campus. However, SIGBots obtained a generous grant from Purdue University to attend the 2022 VEX U World Championship in Dallas, Texas, where BLRS placed second overall, and BLRS2 brought home the World Skills Champion trophy with a high score of 699 points."

      content : "This season started in the middle of the COVID 19 Pandemic and placed many restrictions on our ability to work on robots. Luckily, we were able to remain on campus but with a 5 person limit to the lab and no funding from the computer science department. Among other challenges, we have had to move our workflow to be almost entirely online but nonetheless we're continuing to grow our program by increasing the scale of our robots with advanced programming techniques like odometry and advanced manufacturing techniques like machining metal."

We won every qualifier we went to and qualified 10 times for the World Championships. Due to the outbreak of COVID 19, a virutal worlds was held where we were named the 2020 Virtual Worlds Champions."

      duration : "2018-2019"
      content : "This season focused on creating a simple concept and optimizing it to its full potential. Our team took a non-meta approach to the season leaving the bulk of our scoring ability in one of our robots. This paid off as we won every qualifier we attended, qualifying for the World Championships 8 times. At the World Championships BLRS worked its way up to being the undefeated 1 seed in the Design division, later to be knocked out in the quarterfinals."

      duration : "2017-2018"
      content : "Having 1 robot per team, SIGBots were able to field both BLRS and BLRS1 this season. The approach of having a veteran team and a new member team did not prove to be beneficial to BLRS1. Using a subpar, off-meta design BLRS was able to qualify for worlds and ended up externally stacking their way to the #13 seed at worlds. This marked the first time BLRS has made eliminations at the World Championship"

BLRZ qualified to worlds after winning the tournament but unfortunately BLRS was 6th in global skills, the highest rank to not get a worlds invite."

This season was a large learning experience for the entire team adjusting to the college rules and fielding two robots. In the classic move all new teams make, a decision was made to rebuild a robot before the World Championship.  This resulted in its autonomous code being developed and tested in the van on the drive from Purdue to the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex for the 2011 World Championships."
